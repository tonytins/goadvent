# Go Adventure Project

Text Adventures is something I've always wanted to make. This is my attempt at creating one in Go, based on [Writing a Text Adventure Game in Go](https://gocodecloud.com/blog/2016/03/19/writing-a-text-adventure-game-in-go---part-1/) tutorial from which it'll likely be expanded upon from there.
